        <h3>Activity</h3>    
        <h4>Definition of activity</h4>
        <p>
            Activity was defined by an arbitrary threshold. This would make sense to provide a more rational
            definition of activity, possibly relying on morphological measurements as well as speed. Need, the centre of mass of an animal can remain the same despite the animal moving (e.g. turning, slight tentacle motions).
            
        </p>
        <h4>Temporal structure</h4>
        <p>
                The presented binomial generalised mixed effect model  does not capture the
                structural pattern of activity.
                For instance, activity seems to happen in bursts in most animals. This is problematic, because it involves that activity at a given time $t_m$ depends on a previous state $t_{n-1}$.
                In this respect, it would be interesting to model activity using a generative model such as two state Markov chain.
        </p>
        <h4>Day/Night state is not independent from time</h4>
        <p>Another weakness of the proposed model (but also the experiment) is that night and day status are correlated with time since there is a 24h period.
        Therefore, it is difficult to take apart the effect of both variable.
        Preliminary experiments in the laboratory have tried to alter the period, but results have not been analysed yet.

    <h3>Tracking</h3>
    <h4>Lack of ground truth</h4>
    <p>
    For this project, no ground truth data was available. It would have been a tremendous resource to have a collection of annotated images of snails.
    Without ground truth data, it is very hard to trust the robustness and accuracy of the proposed method and to improve it.
    For instance, the difference observed between day and night could, in principle, come from the fact that the tracking tool detect motion betted with the night frames.
    It was promising to see that the measurements of speed were biologically sound.
    In addition, preliminary visual confirmation could be performed by plotting inferred position on the image.
    Measurement of other features such as area appeared really noisy.
    This could be because snails are highly deformable, or because the tracking pipeline produces non-robust results.
    For this reason, only speed was used.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Back to the lab</h3>    
    <p>
        The findings of this preliminary analysis will gives valuable clues to the experimenters.
        The most critical point is the very strong decrease in activity over time.
        It probably arises from the fact that snails were not fed during the experiment, or that the environment was very stable
        (no changes in humidity or temperature).
        It will be essential to prevent this incidentally induced inactivity to investigate sleep in land snails.
        
        It  nevertheless is very encouraging to observe
        such a clear differential of activity between day and night.
        In addition, it seems that young snails are more active and that <em>Helix asperta</em> is the most active species.
        
    </p>

    <p>Investigation of sleep in this new model remains at a very early stage. This research was done in close collaboration with experimentalists
    and the provided tools (tracking and modelling) could be used to analyse future experiments with few modifications once experimental issues have been addressed.</p>
